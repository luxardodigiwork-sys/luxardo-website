/**
 * FOCUSED REGRESSION TEST — MED-1 (recordRework stage precondition).
 *
 * Not wired into any test runner (the repo has none yet) — same standalone,
 * emulator-only approach as the other functions/src/__tests__ scripts. NOT
 * exported from functions/src/index.ts, so it is never bundled/deployed.
 *
 * Established (not invented) preconditions, per PieceDetailPage.tsx's own
 * `!isClosed && !isReworked` gate and pieces.ts's own documented
 * QC_PENDING-is-guard-exclusive design:
 *   - recordRework must reject a QC_PENDING piece (Guard QC's exclusive
 *     domain for recording a REWORK verdict).
 *   - recordRework must reject a piece already at REWORK (matches the UI's
 *     own !isReworked gate, which already hides the action in this state).
 *   - Every OTHER active stage (OPEN, IN_WORK, QC_PASS, DISPATCH_READY,
 *     TAILOR_ASSIGNED, STITCHING, STITCH_COMPLETE, STORE) remains reworkable
 *     — this is a deliberately broad PM/Admin/Owner correction mechanism,
 *     not a single-predecessor transition, so this test also confirms a
 *     late-stage rework (from DISPATCH_READY) still succeeds unchanged.
 *
 * Scenarios:
 *   1. Valid rework from OPEN succeeds.
 *   2. Valid rework from a late stage (DISPATCH_READY) still succeeds
 *      (confirms the fix did NOT over-restrict beyond the established rule).
 *   3. Invalid: QC_PENDING is rejected with failed-precondition, and the
 *      piece document is completely unmutated afterward.
 *   4. Invalid: an already-REWORK piece is rejected with failed-precondition,
 *      and the piece document is completely unmutated afterward.
 *
 * MUST be run against the Firestore emulator only — refuses to run if
 * FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST is not set, so it can never touch a real project.
 *
 * Run (from functions/):
 *   npm run build
 *   firebase emulators:exec --only firestore --project demo-luxardo-test \
 *     "node lib/__tests__/pieces.med1.test.js"
